# Geographical Location

The Yanomami live in the remote forest of the orinoco river basin in southern Venezuela and the northernmost reaches of the Amazon River basin in Northern Brazil. At over 9.6 million hectares, the Yanomami territory in Brazil is twice the size of Switzerland. In Venezuela, the Yanomami live in the 8.2 million hectare Alto Orinoco – Casiquiare Biosphere Reserve. Together, these areas form the largest forested indigenous territory in the world.

# Brief History

The Yanomami live in vine and lead thatched houses, relocating their villages when the soil wears out or when they become susceptible to attack by other Yanomami people. They migrated across the Bering Straits between Asia and America 15,000 years ago, making their way slowly down to South America. Today thier culture is still practiced in remote parts of Venezuela and their total population stands at around 38,000. The Yanomami are constantly at war with one another yet socially center themselves through trade and sharing food with friendly groups. They first came into sustained contact with outsiders in the 1940s when the Brazilian government sent teams to delimit the frontier with Venezuela. Soon the government’s Indian Protection Service (as it was then called) and religious missionary groups established themselves there. This influx of people led to the first epidemics of measles and flu in which many Yanomami died. In the early 1970s the military government decided to build a road through the Amazon along the northern frontier. With no prior warning bulldozers drove through the community of Opiktheri. Two villages were wiped out from diseases to which they had no immunity. The Yanomami continue to suffer from the devastating and lasting impacts of the road which brought in colonists, diseases and alcohol. Today cattle ranchers and colonists use the road as an access point to invade and deforest the Yanomami area. Additionally, Yanomami survival is also threatened by the past incursions of brazilian miners in the 1990s. 


## Basic Facts

_Girl with a Pearl Earring_ (Dutch: Meisje met de parel) is an oil painting by Dutch Golden Age painter Johannes Vermeer, 
dated c. 1665. Going by various names over the centuries, it became known by its present title towards the end of the 
20th century after the earring worn by the girl portrayed there.[^1]

## Values about and toward the Earth

The Yanomami are hunter agriculturalists who live in large circular houses called yanos or shabonos that house up to 400 people each. Residential areas are located on the outskirts of the yanos while communal areas are located in the middle. The center area is generally used for rituals, feasts, and games. Aditionally, the Yanomami stongly believe in equality and thus have no chief system. 10% of their food is hunted and the majority is either grown or scavenged. Meat is always shared among the people and their land is essential to their spiritual practices, food, and medicines. Thus, “UN Human Rights fully supports the legitimate demands of Brazil´s indigenous peoples to remove illegal miners from their territories,” states Jan Jarab, the UN Human Rights’ Regional Representative for South America.

## Treaties and their Impact

The Yanomami territory is controlled by the Brasil and Venezuelan government. On May 25, 1992 a Presidential decree declared the Yanomami essential to the preservation of Amazonian biodiversity and granted land the size of 94,000km2 - about the size of portugal. In 1991 Brazil’s government set aside an area of some 36,000 square miles (93,240 square km)—roughly 30 percent of their ancestral territory—as a homeland for the Yanomami, but in the early 21st century governmental commitment to the enforcement of boundaries remained intermittent at best.

## Environmental challenges

In the 1980s, up to 40,000 gold miners from Brazil invaded Yanomami land. Since then, mining and ranching have been continuously threatening the Yanomami’s lands. Gold mining has devastated land that is essential to the Yanomami way of life as they rely on the ecosystem and biodiversity in order to survive and practice their culture. 

## Human Rights Concerns and their Impact

Reduced access to health care 
Mining on Yanomami lands has introduced mercury into the environment and water supply. As a result, mercury poisoning is becoming an increasingly prevalent issue within the community. Poisoning harms internal organs and has especially effected children and their growth. Malnutrition has also increased due to changes in their ecosystem. Thus, the Yanomami must now rely on imported foods in order to sustain their youth. As the Yanomami have 
reduced access to health care, these problems are difficult to solve. Lastly, the introduction of drugs and alcohol have caused an increase of domestic and sexual violence towards women and girls. This has caused a rift between generations and disrupted cultural practices
